Booth's Algorithm
Authors: Milien McDermott and Jacob Hillebrand

This python program will perform Booth's Algorithm on two integers between -128
and 127 (8 bits). The program will ask the user for two integers (a multiplicand
and a multiplier), convert the integers to binary, perform the operations of
Booth's Algorithm (and show the steps), and will display the output
in two's complement binary and its decimal equivalent. Happy multiplying!
